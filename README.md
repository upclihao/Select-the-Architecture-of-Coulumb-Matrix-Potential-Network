# Select-the-Architecture-of-Coulumb-Matrix-Potential-Network
Select the best ANN architecture of Coulumb Matrix Potential Network

In this work, we use Coulumb Matrix as the descriptor to represent molecules in GDB databse as the inputs vector of ANN to predict
the atomization energies. Scripts in this packages are steps in selecting the best architecture of this network.
